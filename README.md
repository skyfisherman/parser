README

	in this project, I want to parser the html document.

	sometimes it seems difficult, but I think it is interesting.

	this project will be finished by myself, and welcome to commit.

IN THE BEGINNING

	I plan to resolve this problem.

	first pick up the html tags, the basic elements in a html file;

	and then, build a tree and then analysis it.

	but for what the product is, I havn't thought well.
